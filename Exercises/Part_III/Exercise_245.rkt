; Can we hope to define function=?, which determines whether two functions from numbers to numbers are equal? If so, define the function.
; If not, explain why and consider the implication that you have encountered the first easily definable idea for which you cannot define a function.

; Answer: If we consider the statement on the book: "Mathematicians say that two functions are equal if they compute the same result when given the same inputâ€”for all possible inputs.",
; then we cannot define function=? because there's no way to compare all possible inputs.
